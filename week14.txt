React - Is a JavaScript Library that helps you write complex
front-end applications
* creating reusable UI components 
* Managing and displaying data
* Render arrays of components using .map()
Influenced the design of other libraries like angular and vue.JavaScript

STARTING YOUR FIRST REACT PROJECT:
1. RUN "npx create-react-app greeter-app" in your terminal
2. cd into greeter-app
3. enter "yarn start" to star the dev server
    - correction: the above command doesn't work. Instead use "npm start"
4. Delete the <header> tag and replace it with an <h1> tag that says Hellp React
    - This will return some warnings, but it should still run 
5. Go into src/index.css and change the h1 color to Red.
    - This should change the color to Red in react 
6. Go back into src/index.css and create .greeting and add the attribut blue
7. Go back into App.js and create class=greeting inside the h1 tag

CREATING A CUSTOM COMPONENT 
Creating custom components is what react does really well
1. cd into src
2. mkdir components
3. cd into components
4. touch Greeter.js
NOTE: a Class component must have two things
     - extend React.component
     - a render() methond that returns JSX

USING A CUSTOM COMPONENT
In ordr to import you must do the following: 
    - importing Greeter
    - Wrting a Greeter JSX tag
1. Go back to App.js
2. import Greeter from the components folder
3. Create a Greeter tag: <Greeter></Greeter>
4. Reload in the browser and it should show up in Red

REPEATING A COMPONENT
Simply copy and paste the Greeter tag several times in order to repeat itself

PASSING PROPS
To make each greeting say hello to different people, we'll do the following
